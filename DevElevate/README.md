🔔 Reminder from Project Admin 🛠

Hi 👋,

Just a quick reminder to please complete your assigned task as soon as possible. We're counting on your contribution to keep the project on track! 🚀

✅ As mentioned:
Frontend is fully working
Backend is fully working
Google Authentication is fully working

🚧 Important Note: Before you start working, check the GitHub repository branch.
🔄 First: Sync (pull) to the latest merged code from the main branch.
✅ Then: Start working on your assigned issue or feature.

⚠ Skipping this step can cause merge conflicts and your PR may be rejected.

🚧 *Important Note:* The backend is already deployed on *Render* and the frontend is live on *Vercel* — everything is working properly.

⚠ *Do NOT* remove or change any existing code unrelated to your issue! If your PR modifies or deletes any core code without a valid reason, it will *not* be merged.

🚫 *Strict Rule:* Do *NOT* bypass the login, registration, or Google authentication system. If any such activity is found, you will be *removed and reported* from this project.

Please make sure to follow all the contribution guidelines carefully to avoid delays or PR rejections.

If you’re stuck or need help, feel free to reach out.
